<h2>Steam Region Restrict Bypasser</h2>

      <p>Yes you heard me right, You can get A.V.A Alliance on Region Restricted Country with my website</p>

<h2>Some Info</h2>

      <p>Before you continue, please consider supporting me by following me on twitter : @DanHerePE. Now, You MUST have steam installed&opened before continuing and also this will not work on mobile devices.</p>

<h2>Use the bypass tool</h2>

      <p>You can only bypass A.V.A right now, Im too lazy</p>

<input type="button" value="Get : A.V.A - Alliance of Valiant Arms" onClick="location.href='steam://run/102700'"/>

<h2>Help?</h2>

<p>There should be a pop-up from either your web browser which then you need to press ok to get the game, or from steam for game setup. If neither shows up, check if your not using an in-game web browser or your steam is off/logged off. Still need help? Contact @DanHerePE, me, at Twitter Direct Message so I can help you.</p>
