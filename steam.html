      <h2>Steam Region Restrict Bypasser</h2>

        <p>Yes you heard me right, You can get any Region Restricted steam games here (It counts as you got the game from steam so you can get achievement items on sertain games).</p>

      <h2>Get Started</h2>

        <p>Before you continue, please consider supporting me by following me on <a href="https://twitter.com/danherepe/follow">Twitter</a>. Now, You MUST have steam installed & opened before continuing.</p>

      <h2>Use The Tool</h2>

        <p>You cannot use this tool if you dont know your game's Id</p>

          <input type="button" value="Launch Tool" onClick="launchTool()"/>

      <h2>Need Help?</h2>

        <p>First enter the games Id in to the Tool and press 'Ok'.There should be a pop-up about steam bootstrap which you need to press ok to start the game download setup. If nothing shows up, check if your not using an in-game web browser or your steam is off/Not logged in.</p>

      <h2>If You Are Going For Achievement Items</h2>

        <p>If you are downloading sertain games just for their Achievement Items, I HIGHLY suggest you to visit <a href="http://gib.me/sam/">Steam Achievement Manager</a> to hack steam achievement and get the item before download finishes. PLEASE READ ALL DIRECTIONS GIVEN FROM THE WEBSITE, OR YOUR ACCOUNT CAN BE VAC BANNED, AND I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR BAN.</p>

      <script>
        function launchTool() {
          gameid = prompt("Please enter the game Id","102700 is A.V.A");
          if (gameid != "" && gameid != null) {
            window.location.href='steam://run/' + gameid
          }
        }
